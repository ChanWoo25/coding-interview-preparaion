## Introduction

### The purpose of coding interview

It is about answering questions ***better than other candidates***.

마침내 코딩을 시작하면서 그는 초기 해결책을 가지고 코드를 훑어보았지만 그가 포착하지 못한 실수로 가득 차 있었다. 비록 그가 우리가 본 것 중 최악의 후보는 아니었지만, 그는 "기준"을 충족하는 것과는 거리가 멀었습니다. 거부되었습니다.

네가 C로 고수준의 Tree 자료구조를 다시 만들수 있는 것은 중요하지 않다. 애초에 면접관들은 대학 이후로 그것들을 본적도 없는 사람들이다.

너는 '진짜' 인터뷰를 준비해야 한다.
'진짜'문제들을 가지고 그 패턴들을 익혀야 한다. 그것은 새로운 알고리즘을 개발하는 것이지. 기존이 것을 암기하는 문제가 아니다.ㅊ

The focus of Cracking the Coding Interview is algorithm, coding, and design questions.

behavioral questions은 직무에 따라 너무 다를 것이기 때문에 제외하고, 기본적인 문법과 C++ 상속, 클래스 등과 관련된 것들보다는 더 배울 것이 있는 내용에 더 지면을 할애했다.

코딩 문제로 당신에 대한 정량적인 평가는 사실 불가능하다.

Analytical skills:

- Did you need much help solving the problem?
- How optimal was your solution?
- How long did it take you to arrive at a solution?
- If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?

Coding skills

- Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code?
- Was it clean and well-organized?
- Did you think about potential errors?
- Did you use good style?

Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals

- Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?

Experience:

- Have you made good technical decisions in the past?
- Have you built interesting, challenging projects?
- Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
- 추진력, 주도성 및 기타 중요한 요소를 보여 주었나요?

Culture fit / Communication skills:

- Do your personality and values fit with the company and team?
- Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

보통 알고리즘 질문에서는 앞선 3개에 대한 평가가 이루어진다. 비중은 환경에 따라 너무도 달라질 수 있다.

Why??

1. Lots of great candidates don't do well in these sorts of interviews.
2. You could look up the answer if it did ever come up.
3. You rarely have to use data structures such as binary search trees in the real world. If you did need to,
you could surely learn it.
4. Whiteboard coding is an artificial environment. You would never code on the whiteboard in the real world, obviously.

These complaints aren't without merit. In fact, I agree with all of them, at least in part.
At the same time, there is reason to do things this way for some—not all—positions.

It's not important that you agree with this logic, but it is a good idea to understand why these questions are being asked.
It helps offer a little insight into the interviewer's mindset.

### 9-1. Arrays and Strings (p100)

Please note that array questions and string questions are often interchangeable.

That is, a question that this book states using an array may be asked instead as a string question, and vice versa.

 every day check the mail in the morning and second to keep on applying for open positions on daily basis.
He was confident on wrting code, but not on the algorithms, so he just watched videos only.
=> Unfortunately He was not able to write any code in first two coding rounds.

Things to remember for DSA round :

1. Discuss the problem before deep diving into it.
2. Start with a brute force solution without thinking much on optimisation.
3. Be vocal while writing code and verifying your code - keep telling whatever you are thinking.
4. Must dry run your code and effort spent on thinking about corner cases.
5. If asked with behavioural questions, then keep it short and direct - to save more time for coding.

Things to do for DSA preparation:

1. Complete all the topic wise sections in the study plan section of the leet code.
2. Practice questions in a time constrained manner, no point of spending hours in a single question.
3. Easy and medium level questions are sufficient enough to crack DSA rounds.
4. Once you complete the study plan you can refer to the tutorial by Fraz on a set of 250 questions.
   One thing I would like to suggest is to remove the topic header in the excel sheet, so that
   when you attempt a question from the sheet you should not be aware of which topic it is from and
   that you should identify yourself. Also keep nothing down things you learnt from each of the
   questions - this will help you to revise concepts later. Repeat good questions/ questions that
   you find difficult to solve and keep repeating until you are convinced.
